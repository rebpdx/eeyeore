  Firmware for a cloud that flashes like lightning.

  I saw a few examples of people making these clouds out of paper and polyester,
  but wanted something a little more interactive. This project does so by adding a
  network of addressable LED strips in such a layout that it's a web of
  permutations providing different angles and lengths allowing the cloud to flash
  at random places.
